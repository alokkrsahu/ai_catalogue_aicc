# Password Change Functionality Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Added a secure password change functionality accessible from the user dropdown menu in the top right corner of the navigation bar. Users can now easily change their passwords without needing to go through the password reset flow.

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoint
- **URL**: `POST /api/change-password/`
- **Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)
- **Purpose**: Allow authenticated users to change their password

### Serializer: `PasswordChangeSerializer`
Located in `backend/api/serializers.py`

**Features**:
- ✅ Current password validation
- ✅ New password strength validation (Django's built-in validators)
- ✅ Prevents setting the same password as current
- ✅ Secure password hashing with Django's `set_password()`

**Fields**:
```python
{
    "current_password": "string (required)",
    "new_password": "string (required, validated)"
}
```

### API View: `change_password`
Located in `backend/api/views.py`

**Security Features**:
- ✅ Requires authentication
- ✅ Validates current password before allowing change
- ✅ Uses Django's built-in password validation
- ✅ Proper error handling and responses

**Response Format**:
```json
// Success (200)
{
    "detail": "Password changed successfully.",
    "message": "Your password has been updated successfully."
}

// Validation Error (400)
{
    "error": "Invalid data provided",
    "errors": {
        "current_password": ["Current password is incorrect."],
        "new_password": ["Password validation error message"]
    }
}
```

### URL Configuration
Added to `backend/core/urls.py`:
```python
path('api/change-password/', change_password, name='change_password'),
```

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

### Password Change Modal Component
**File**: `frontend/src/lib/components/PasswordChangeModal.svelte`

**Features**:
- ✅ Modern, responsive modal design with Oxford Blue theme
- ✅ Real-time password strength indicator
- ✅ Password visibility toggles for all fields
- ✅ Client-side validation before submission
- ✅ Visual password requirements checklist
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**Password Strength Validation**:
- Minimum 8 characters

- Number
- Special character
- Visual strength meter (Weak/Fair/Strong)

**User Experience**:
- Clear form with proper labels and placeholders
- Immediate feedback on password requirements
- Confirmation required for new password
- Loading states during submission
- Success/error toast notifications

### Navigation Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte`

**Added Features**:
- ✅ "Change Password" menu item in desktop dropdown
- ✅ "Change Password" menu item in mobile menu
- ✅ Consistent icon usage (key icon)
- ✅ Modal state management
- ✅ Automatic dropdown closure when opening modal

**Menu Structure**:
```
User Dropdown:
├── [User Info Display]
├── Admin Dashboard (admin only)
├── 👤 Profile
├── 🔑 Change Password (NEW)
└── 🚪 Sign out
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Backend Security
1. **Authentication Required**: Only logged-in users can access
2. **Current Password Verification**: Must provide correct current password
3. **Password Validation**: Uses Django's built-in password validators
4. **Password Hashing**: Secure hashing with Django's `set_password()`
5. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation
6. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without exposing sensitive info

### Frontend Security
1. **Token Authentication**: Uses JWT token from auth store
2. **Client-side Validation**: Prevents weak passwords before submission
3. **Secure Password Display**: Toggle visibility with eye icons
4. **Form Reset**: Clears sensitive data when modal closes
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error display without exposing system details

## 📱 User Interface

### Desktop Experience
1. User clicks their avatar in top-right corner
2. Dropdown menu appears with user info and options
3. User clicks "🔑 Change Password"
4. Modal opens with password change form
5. User fills out form with real-time validation feedback
6. Submit button enables only when form is valid
7. Success/error feedback via toast notifications

### Mobile Experience
1. User taps hamburger menu icon
2. Mobile menu slides out
3. User taps "🔑 Change Password" in user section
4. Modal opens (responsive for mobile screens)
5. Same form experience as desktop
6. Touch-friendly interface elements

### Visual Design
- **Theme**: Oxford Blue (#002147) consistent with app branding
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Icons**: FontAwesome icons for visual clarity
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Checklist
**Desktop**:
- [ ] Click user avatar → dropdown appears
- [ ] Click "Change Password" → modal opens
- [ ] Enter weak password → see strength indicator as "Weak"
- [ ] Enter strong password → see strength indicator as "Strong"
- [ ] Submit with wrong current password → see error message
- [ ] Submit with valid data → see success message
- [ ] Close modal → form resets

**Mobile**:
- [ ] Tap hamburger menu → mobile menu appears
- [ ] Tap "Change Password" → modal opens
- [ ] Test all form interactions on touch device
- [ ] Verify modal is responsive and usable

**API Testing**:
```bash
# Test with correct credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/change-password/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"current_password": "current123", "new_password": "NewPassword123!"}'

# Test with incorrect current password
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/change-password/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"current_password": "wrong", "new_password": "NewPassword123!"}'
```

### Error Scenarios to Test
1. **Wrong current password** → "Current password is incorrect"
2. **Weak new password** → Password strength requirements
3. **Same as current password** → "New password cannot be the same"
4. **Empty fields** → Required field validation
5. **Password mismatch** → "Passwords do not match"
6. **Network error** → "Failed to change password. Please try again."
7. **Unauthenticated** → "Authentication required"
