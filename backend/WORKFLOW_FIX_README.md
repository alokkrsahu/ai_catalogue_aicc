# Workflow Execution Fix Summary

## Problem
The workflow execution was failing with the error:
```
❌ ORCHESTRATOR: REAL workflow execution failed: You cannot call this from an async context - use a thread or sync_to_async.
```

## Root Cause
Django model attributes were being accessed synchronously from within an async function (`execute_workflow`). Specifically:
- `workflow.workflow_id`
- `workflow.graph_json` 
- `workflow.name`
- `workflow.project.project_id`
- `workflow.save()`

When Django runs in an async context, all database operations must be wrapped with `sync_to_async()`.

## Solution Applied
Modified `/backend/agent_orchestration/conversation_orchestrator.py`:

1. **Pre-fetch all workflow data at the start of `execute_workflow` method:**
   ```python
   workflow_id = await sync_to_async(lambda: workflow.workflow_id)()
   graph_json = await sync_to_async(lambda: workflow.graph_json)()
   workflow_name = await sync_to_async(lambda: workflow.name)()
   project_id = await sync_to_async(lambda: workflow.project.project_id)()
   ```

2. **Use pre-fetched data throughout the method instead of direct model access**

3. **Wrapped all `workflow.save()` calls in proper async functions:**
   ```python
   async def update_workflow_stats():
       workflow.total_executions += 1
       workflow.successful_executions += 1
       workflow.last_executed_at = timezone.now()
       # ... other updates
       workflow.save()
   
   await sync_to_async(update_workflow_stats)()
   ```

## Files Modified
- `/backend/agent_orchestration/conversation_orchestrator.py` - Fixed async/sync context issues

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Restart the Django backend server
2. Navigate to the Agent Orchestration page in AICC
3. Create a workflow with Start → AI Assistant → End nodes
4. Click the "Execute" button

**Expected Result:** Workflow executes successfully without the 500 Internal Server Error.

## Status
✅ **Fix Applied and Ready for Testing**

The async/sync context mismatch has been resolved by ensuring all Django ORM operations are properly wrapped with `sync_to_async`.
