# 🔧 MIGRATION FIX APPLIED ✅

## The Issue
The migration dependency was pointing to a non-existent migration `0020_add_enhanced_template_fields`. 

## The Fix Applied ✅
I've updated the migration file `users/migrations/0021_add_project_api_keys.py` to depend on the correct migration: `0002_workflowexecution_messages_data`

## Next Steps - Run These Commands:

### 1. First, generate and set your encryption key:
```bash
cd backend
python generate_encryption_key.py
```

Copy the output and set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export PROJECT_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY='your-generated-key-here'
```

### 2. Now run the migration:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Test the encryption system:
```bash
python manage.py setup_project_api_keys test-encryption
```

### 4. List your projects:
```bash
python manage.py setup_project_api_keys list-projects
```

### 5. Run the test suite:
```bash
python manage.py test project_api_keys
```

## Expected Output

### For migration:
```
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, users, project_api_keys
Running migrations:
  Applying users.0021_add_project_api_keys... OK
```

### For encryption test:
```
Testing encryption service...
✅ Encryption successful: [number] characters
✅ Decryption successful: True
🔐 Encryption service is working correctly!
```

### For list projects:
```
📋 Listing all projects and their API key status...

🔹 Project: Your Project Name
   ID: your-project-uuid
   Owner: your@email.com
   Created: 2024-01-15
   API Keys: None configured
```

## If You Get Encryption Errors

If you see "PROJECT_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable must be configured", make sure to:

1. **Generate a key first**:
   ```bash
   python generate_encryption_key.py
   ```

2. **Set the environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export PROJECT_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY='the-key-from-step-1'
   ```

3. **Or add to .env file**:
   ```bash
   echo 'PROJECT_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-key-here' >> .env
   ```

## Ready to Use! 🎉

Once the migration and encryption test pass, you can start using project-specific API keys:

```bash
# Add an API key to a project
python manage.py setup_project_api_keys add-key \
  --project-id your-project-uuid \
  --provider openai \
  --api-key sk-your-openai-key \
  --user-email your@email.com \
  --validate

# Check the status
python manage.py setup_project_api_keys list-keys --project-id your-project-uuid
```

The system is now ready! 🚀
