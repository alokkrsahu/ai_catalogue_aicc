Wind Energy:
- Uses wind turbines to generate electricity
- Highly efficient in windy areas
- Both onshore and offshore installations

Hydroelectric:
- Generates power from flowing water
- Reliable and long-lasting infrastructure
- Can provide grid stability services

Geothermal:
- Uses heat from the Earth's core
- Provides consistent, baseload power
- Low environmental footprint

Benefits of renewable energy include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, energy independence, and long-term cost savings.''',
